Socket Programming
This is a project which uses socket programming to send and receive data. It uses TCP connections to do the same. All data sent by the sender is broadcasted to all other clients in the network. There is a GUI which allows users to send messages, files, and videos.

How to run:
All users are connected to the same network.
Run the command ipconfig to identify the IPv4 address (use the one under wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi).
On one laptop, start the server with the command python server.py.
Once server is on and listening, have all clients start the gui by using python gui.py.
